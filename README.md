# Reach for Gem

**Reach for Gem** is a stealth-like 3D game developed using Unity.  
Players must find keys, overcome various obstacles waiting for them, and reach the gem without being caught by the enemy.

I have been developing this game solo to enhance my coding skills. In this project, I implemented:

- Player movement  
- Field of view for both the player and enemy  
- Camera controls that follow the player  
- Enemy movement with and without AI  
- Inventory system for both in-game use and UI  
- Player interactions with the environment  
- Transition system  
- Scene management  
- Animations  
- Bomb, security camera, and laser mechanics to detect the player
