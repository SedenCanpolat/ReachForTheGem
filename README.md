## 👨‍💻 Developer: Seden Canpolat

I have been developing this game solo to enhance my coding skills. **It's still in development and serves as a prototype.** So far in this project, I have implemented:

- Player movement  
- Field of view system for both the player and the enemy  
- Camera controls that follow the player  
- Enemy movement with and without AI  
- Inventory system for both in-game use and UI  
- Player interactions with the environment  
- Transition system  
- Scene management  
- Animations  
- Bomb, security camera, and laser mechanics to detect the player
